```


**Additional notes**

* For a custom cert, stop the container and put the cert in "/config/cert" it needs to be named "mydomain.p12" and have the password "tplink"
* The owner of the config directory needs sufficent permissions (UUID 99 / GID 100). (For manual configs, backups etc on the host system)
* Mongodb dosent start if "/config" is mapped to an fuse mount, shfs, mergerfs etc...
* Should be run with network "host" or "macvlan", so it can find the AP´s
* Username and password will be linked to controller (if you restore a backup this will only restore AP,SSID,etc... settings, not the base controller username/pass()EAP limitation)
* Always make an backup of your settings before a new release "EAP controller version"(for a reinstall with same version it´s not necessary)
* If it dosen´t start make sure there is just one controller on the same subnet (EAP limitataion)
* This buils is only X86 with TP-Links budeled binaries
